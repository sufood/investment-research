    "Data Science / Analytics is all about finding valuable insights from the given dataset. In short, finding answers that could help business. In this project, we will see how to get started with Data Analysis in Python. Since usually such projects are based on in-built datasets like iris, it becomes harder for the learner to connect with the analysis and hence learning becomes difficult. To overcome this, the dataset that we use in this notebook is INDIAN_RAILWAYS Dataset posted on Datasets sourced from clipsheet. INDIAN RAILWAYS is one of the important issues of our day-to-day life. Analysis and Visualization of the TIME TABLE of INDIAN RAILWAYS can make access to the Schedules more convenient.\n",

That tells us two things: Python Expressions are very crispy in terms of its syntax and the second thing is, it doesn’t need to be tens and hundreds of line to bring out a valuable insight — just a few lines could do the magic — If you’re asking the right question!\n",
